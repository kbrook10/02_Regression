### Agenda:

* Tip: For datasets that display linear form when on a scatter plot, it may
be beneficial to address with linear models. We usually fit a line to the data
using least squares. The goal is to find the line that results in the minimum
sum of squared residuals. This generates y = mx + b. Caution high variance
may lead to overfitting.

1. Generalized Linear Models
- Ridge Regression -> Helps ensure the model does not overfit the training
data. This is accomplished by introducing Bias to the model is fit to the
data. This Bias should help reduce the variance. By providing less fit
Ridge Regression may provide better long-term predictions.
